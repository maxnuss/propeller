                    <h3>About the Authors</h3>
                    <p class="medium">We (Mike Wilner and Max Nussenbaum) met in Detroit in 2013, as early members of the <a href="http://ventureforamerica.org">Venture for America</a> fellowship program. By 2014, we had each started our own companies. As first-time founders, we faced the new challenge of fundraising. And at first, we were terrible at it. Which is no surprise&mdash;fundraising is really hard!</p>
                    <p class="medium">Although both of our companies eventually failed, we ended up becoming pretty good at early-stage fundraising along the way, raising a combined $4M from all sorts of investors: famous ones like <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla Ventures</a>, <a href="https://svangel.com/">SV Angel</a>, and <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>, but also tons of smaller angels and VCs you’ve probably never heard of.</p>
                    <p class="medium">Over the years, as other founders started coming to us for fundraising advice, we realized that there wasn’t a good source for the kind of guidance we’d have wanted to see when we were raising our companies’ first rounds.</p>
                    <p class="medium">And lots of the best advice out there came from VCs&mdash;nothing against VCs, but they’re not exactly neutral parties&mdash;or was written for people who already had connections. There wasn&rsquo;t much out there that felt targeted towards the types of founders we were&mdash;the types of founders most first-time founders are.</p>
                    <p class="medium">This book is the guide we wish we’d had when we were first starting out.</p>

                    <p class="quote large">As the founder of an early-stage VC firm, I was both humbled and inspired to read <em>Oversubscribed</em>.</p>
                    <p class="medium">Humbled, because there was so much information in the book I found useful and presented in a clear and fresh way, and inspired because the path they lay out will definitely increase the odds of success for any founder.</p>
                    <p class="medium">In the book they discuss all aspects of fundraising from various perspectives, so a founder will understand in better terms what an angel investor or VC will be looking for or expecting.</p>
                    <p class="medium">The book is primarily geared towards new founders, but VCs, angels, family offices, institutional investors and others in the startup world will benefit from reading it. Oversubscribed will become required reading at Chaac Ventures, and we will be distributing copies to our portfolio founders (both current and prospective).</p>

It takes the process of fundraising from a mystery box to a paint-by-number. <em>Oversubscribed</em> is one of the best guard rails you could be lucky enough to encounter&mdash;don&rsquo;t be foolish enough not to read it.&rdquo;</p>
